      <strong>UT01_1 </strong> <a href="../links/UT01_1 Introduction to the computer systems.docx" download> <strong>Introduction to the computer systems.docx</strong></a>
      <ul>
        <li> Define a computer system.<br><br>
          A <b>computer system </b> is the set of physical elements or hardware
          that are necessary for the explotation of computer programs or software.</li><br>
        <li> Mention and explain the basic functions of a computer. <br>
        <br><ul>
          <li><u> Accept and transmit information: </u> through the input/output devices, the computer receives and communicates with the exterior. 
            This devides are responsible for encoding the input info to a format that the computer understands and encode it to transmit it abroad.
          </li>
          <li><u> Data storage: </u>this function is carried out on storage devices, of which the
            computer has a great variety, depending on their nature and their specific
            purpose.</li>
          <li><u>Data processing: </u>the main component that performs this function is the
            processor, that, fundamentally, is in charge of reading a series of instructions
            from RAM, encoded in a way that it can understand them, and execute them in
            a pre-established order.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <li> Mention the elements of a computer system. </li><br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li><u> Physical elements (hardware): </u> set of physical devices that make up the
            computer or computer system. </li>
          <li><u> Logical elements (software): </u> it is made up of applications and data that exploit
            hardware resources (Computer programs, system softwate and firmware (the software that handles the BIOS of the computer)). </li>
          <li><u> Human component: </u> the users who interact with the
            computers, and those who develop software to make this interaction possible. </li>
        </ul><br>
        <li> Mention and briefly explain the types of computers. </li>
        <li> Mention and briefly explain the generations of computers. </li>
        <li> Describe the computer components and know how to classify them. </li>
        <li> Explain the Von Neumann architecture. </li>
        <li> Describe the function of every unit and its components. </li>
        <li> Explain the existing types of buses. </li>
        <li> Explain how the CPU works. </li>
        <li> Explain how the memory works. </li>
        <li> Mention and briefly explain the types of software. </li>
        <li> Giving an ASCII code table, converting a text to numbers. </li>
        <li> Perform operations with data storage units (bit, byte, Kilobyte…). </li>
      </ul>
