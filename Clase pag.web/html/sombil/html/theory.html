    <h1> Operating Systems </h1>
    <p><b> An operating system </b> is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the 
        computer hardware and controls the execution of all kinds of programs.</p>

    <p>A user interface refers to the part of an operating system, program or device that allows a user to enter and receive information.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Text user interface:</strong> In this case, the commands are entered as text.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphical user interface:</strong> In most OS, the primary user interface is graphical, instead of typing the commands you manipulate various graphical objects with a pointing device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Historical background of operating system</h2>

    <h3>First Generation (1940-1959): Vacuum tubes and boards.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Machines like ENIAC, MARK I → had no operating system.</li>
        <li>When UNIVAC I appears → the concept of an operating system was born → EXEC I</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Second Generation of Computer (1960 – 1965): transistors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Type of operating systems: Batch operating systems (sistemas operativos por lotes). They executed the jobs one by one in batch. When one job from the batch executed, then the second job has taken from it and so on.</li>
        <li>Programs were on plugboards, later, punch cards</li>
        <li>With UNIVAC 7 appears → EXEC II</li>
        <li>Other type of operating systems: Time-Sharing Operating Systems (sistemas operativos de tiempo compartido). Each task is given some time to execute so that all the tasks work. Each user gets the time of CPU. These systems are also known as Multitasking Systems. → CTSS</li>
        <li>The Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) (1962) was designed at MIT as an experimental time-sharing system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Third Generation of Computer (1966 – 1971): integrated circuits</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In the early 1960s, each computer had its own operating system, which made them incompatible with each other, even for computers from the same company.</li>
        <li>After the success of CTSS, MIT, Bell Labs and General Electric decided to undertake the development of a «computer service», a machine that would serve hundreds of timeshare users.</li>
        <li>Despite the limited commercial success of MULTICS, some of its characteristics influenced.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fourth Generation of Computer (1971 – 1981)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The first operating system for microcomputers was CP / M (Control Program for Microcomputers), developed by Gary Kildall for the Intel 8080 processor.</li>
        <li>The other great operating system of the time was MS-DOS. This system has its origin in the DOS system (Disk Operating System) of Seattle Computer Products. This was acquired by Bill Gates and it soon dominated the PC market.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fifth Generation of Computer (1981 – Current)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Microsoft looked for a successor to MS-DOS, so it produced a graphical interface system which called Windows and was originally running on top of MS-DOS, that is, it was a shell and not a real operating system.</li>
        <li>MAC OS, the operating system was introduced in 1984 to run the company’s Macintosh line of personal computers (PCs).</li>
        <li>Solaris is an operating system based on Unix developed in 1992 by Sun Microsystems.</li>
        <li>In 1995 he released the first version of Windows that could be considered a true operating system, Windows 95.</li>
    </ul>
