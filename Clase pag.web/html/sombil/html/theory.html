        <ul>
          <li><u> Accept and transmit information: </u> through the input/output devices, the computer receives and communicates with the exterior. 
          This devides are responsible for encoding the input info to a format that the computer understands and encode it to transmit it abroad.
          </li>
          <li><u> Data storage: </u>this function is carried out on storage devices, of which the
            computer has a great variety, depending on their nature and their specific
            purpose.</li>
          <li><u>Data processing: </u>the main component that performs this function is the
            processor, that, fundamentally, is in charge of reading a series of instructions
            from RAM, encoded in a way that it can understand them, and execute them in
            a pre-established order.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <li> Mention the elements of a computer system. </li><br>
        <br>
        <ul>
