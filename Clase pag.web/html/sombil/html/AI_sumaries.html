    <h1>COMPUTER SYSTEM CONCEPT</h1>

  <p>A computer is an electronic device, capable of receiving information, storing it for a period of time and processing it to offer the result abroad.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Accept and transmit information: through the input/output devices, the computer receives and communicates with the exterior. These devices encode the input information to a format that the computer understands and also encode it for transmission abroad.</li>
    <li>Data storage: this function is carried out on storage devices, of which the computer has a great variety, depending on their nature and their specific purpose.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Computers can be classified as one of three types: a supercomputer, a general-purpose computer, or a special-purpose computer.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A supercomputer is a computer with high performance compared to a general-purpose computer, often used in research, scientific, or military environments.</li>
    <li>A server is a computer that accepts and responds to requests made over a network. The device that makes the request and receives a response from the server is called a client.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF COMPUTERS</h2>

  <p>The history of computing is longer than the history of computing hardware and modern computing technology. In ancient times, methods for mathematical calculations were known. In the 17th century, calculating machines began to be invented.</p>

  <h3>Generations of computers</h3>

  <p>Analytical Engine, in which the basic framework of today‘s computers is based on. Generally speaking, computers can be classified into five generations.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>First Generation of Computer:</strong> Vacuum tubes and boards. In the mid-1940s, Howard Aiken at Harvard and John von Neumann at Princeton, among others, managed to build calculating machines.</li>
    <li><strong>Second Generation of Computer:</strong> Transistors. Replaced vacuum tubes, smaller, and consumed less electricity. Communication with these computers is through high-level languages or programming languages.</li>
    <li><strong>Third Generation of Computer:</strong> Integrated circuits. Emerged with the development of integrated circuits, leading to the invention of the microprocessor.</li>
    <li><strong>Fourth Generation of Computer:</strong> Characterized by the appearance of the microprocessor. The age of the personal computer arrived.</li>
    <li><strong>Fifth Generation of Computer - 2019 - Quantum Computers:</strong> IBM presented its first commercial quantum computer, called the IBM Q System One, in 2019.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>COMPUTER COMPONENTS</h2>

  <p>Any kind of computer consists of HARDWARE and SOFTWARE.</p>

  <h3>Hardware</h3>

  <p>Computer hardware is the collection of physical elements that constitute a computer system, all of which are physical objects that can be touched.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computer case:</strong> Contains the central processing unit (CPU) and other essential components.</li>
    <li><strong>Peripheral device:</strong> Hardware device that isn’t required for the computer's primary function. Includes input, output, and input/output devices.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Input devices: Used to enter information into a computer system.</li>
      <li>Output devices: Used to send data from a digital device, such as a computer, to a user or another device.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Storage devices:</strong> Used to store application and user data, such as hard disk drives and USB flash drives.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Modern computers are based on a stored-program concept introduced by John Von Neumann. The basic structure is like Von Neumann architecture.</p>

  <p><strong>Buses:</strong> The types of computer buses are the address bus, the data bus, and the control bus.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The address bus: A one-way pathway that carries information about where data is stored in memory.</li>
    <li>The data bus: A two-way pathway carrying the actual data to and from the main memory.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What is a CPU?</h3>

  <p>The central processing unit is the brain of the computer that processes program instructions.</p>

  <p><strong>Arithmetic logic unit and Registers.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Registers are small amounts of high-speed memory contained within the CPU. They are used to store small amounts of data needed during processing.</li>
    <li>The control unit of the central processing unit regulates and integrates the operations of the computer. It decodes and executes instructions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What is a Main Memory Unit?</h3>

  <p>RAM is the hardware in a computing device where the operating system, application programs, and data in current use are kept for quick access by the device's processor. RAM is usually associated with DRAM, a type of memory module.</p>

  <h3>What is an Input/Output Unit?</h3>

  <p>The input/output unit communicates the microprocessor with components such as auxiliary memories, external storage units, or peripherals.</p>

  <p>Computer software falls into three broad classes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>System software:</strong> The principal system software is the operating system, managing hardware, data, program files, and other system resources, providing means for user control via a graphical user interface.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Software licenses</h3>

  <p>A software license is a contract between the entity that created and supplied an application, source code, or related product and its end user.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Proprietary –</strong> Also referred to as "closed source."</li>
    <li><strong>"Free software"</strong> means software that respects users' freedom and community.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>While open source is a development philosophy that is more business-oriented, free software is a social and moral philosophy. That’s why the term open source is more pleasant to the corporate world because it places less emphasis on freedom.</p>
  <h3>Why are we going to learn the numbering systems?</h2>

  <p>The computer is an electronic device. In fact, any system that can represent at least two states can represent information. To represent a number, we use the binary system, not the decimal number system that we use in everyday life.</p>

  <h2>Binary system</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The base of the binary number system is 2, because it has only two digits.</li>
    <li>The binary system is the one that the computer would use internally.</li>
    <li>Each binary digit is also called a bit. Binary number system is also a positional value system, where each digit has a value expressed in powers of 2.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>8 bits = 256 values</strong></p>

  <h2>Octal Number System</h2>

  <p>Octal Number System is a type of number system that has a base of eight and uses digits from 0 to 7.</p>

  <h2>Representation of Characters</h2>

  <p>Over time there have been different encodings encoding/codificación = to convert for storing characters, for example, the ASCII code.</p>

  <h3>ASCII</h3>

  <p>The ASCII code predates the Internet and has been around since the days of teletypes and mechanical printers.</p>

  <h4>When is ASCII code used?</h4>

  <p>Once the ASCII value is known, that value can be converted to binary. In the following example, we take the word "hope" and show how it is converted to binary that the computer understands.</p>

  <p><strong>ASCII was the first major character encoding standard for data processing.</strong></p>

  <h2>DATA STORAGE</h2>

  <p>With one bit, we can store little information, just a 0 or a 1.</p>
